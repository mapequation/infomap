# Infomap Software Package

Infomap is a network clustering algorithm based on the
[Map equation](http://www.mapequation.org/publications.html#Rosvall-Axelsson-Bergstrom-2009-Map-equation).

For more info, see [www.mapequation.org](http://www.mapequation.org).


Getting started:
--------------------------------------------------------
In a terminal with the GNU Compiler Collection installed,
just run `make` in the current directory to compile the
code with the included `Makefile`. Call `./Infomap` to run.

Run `./Infomap --help` or visit [options](http://www.mapequation.org/code.html#Options)
for a list of available options.

Infomap can be used both as a standalone program and as a library.
See the `examples` folder for examples.

We also include a [Jupyter notebook](examples/python/infomap-examples.ipynb)
with the examples that can be viewed online.
