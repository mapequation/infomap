/**
 * A wrapper for the C++ file stream class that automatically closes
 * the file stream when the destructor is called. Allocate it on the
 * stack to have it automatically closed when going out of scope.
 *
 * Note:
 * In C++, the only code that can be guaranteed to be executed after an
 * exception is thrown are the destructors of objects residing on the stack.
 *
 * You can exploit that fact to avoid resource leaks by tying all resources
 * to the lifespan of an object allocated on the stack. This technique is
 * called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).
